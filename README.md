### Project Overview

The DLL File Scanning Tool is designed specifically for Windows users to help them quickly identify and repair missing or corrupted DLL files in their system. With an efficient scanning mechanism, this tool aims to enhance system stability and security, providing users with a smoother experience. We strive to develop practical features in the simplest way possible.

### Core Features

- **Automatic Scanning**: The tool can automatically scan specified directories for DLL files, quickly identifying any that are missing or corrupted.
  
- **One-Click Repair**: Users can easily repair missing DLL files with a single click, eliminating the hassle of manual searches and downloads.

- **Detailed Log Recording**: After each scan, the tool generates a detailed log file that records the scan time, results, and actions taken for repairs, allowing users to review and track issues conveniently.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The straightforward graphical user interface makes the operation intuitive, ensuring that even those with minimal technical knowledge can navigate it with ease.

### Usage Guide

1. **Download and Installation**:
   - Download the tool's compressed package from the project homepage and extract it to a local directory.
   
2. **DLL Files**:
   - The `dll` folder in the repository contains the `dll.sav` file, which records all the relevant files.

3. **Running the Tool**:
   - Double-click the `dllscan.bat` file and follow the prompts provided by the program to complete the necessary operations.

4. **Viewing Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete, open the generated log file to obtain detailed information about the scan results and repair actions.

### Important Notes

- If you are unsure about our trustworthiness, please back up important data before making any system modifications to prevent data loss or instability.

- Ensure that your operating system is Windows; other platforms may not support this tool properly.

### Additional Usage Methods
- If you only want to know which DLL files are missing from your computer, you can simply download `Dllscan.bat` and `Dll.sav`. These two files will help you identify the missing DLL files, but this approach will disable the tool's repair functionality.

- If you already know which DLL files are missing or if you simply want to download specific DLL files, you can look for them in the `Dll` folder. While this can be cumbersome, you can also download both `Dllscan.bat` and the `Dll` folder together. This way, you can quickly find the required DLL by entering its full name in the second function of the program's main menu. If you do this, the program will automatically copy the necessary DLL files to the `system32` folder.
