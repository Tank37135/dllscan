### Project Overview

The DLL File Scanning Tool is specifically designed for Windows users, aimed at helping them quickly identify and repair missing or corrupted DLL files within their system. With an efficient scanning mechanism, this tool enhances system stability and security, providing users with a smoother experience. Our goal is to create practical features in the simplest way possible.

### Core Features

- **Automatic Scanning**: The tool can automatically scan a specified directory for DLL files, quickly identifying any that are missing or corrupted.

- **One-Click Repair**: Users can easily initiate a one-click repair for missing DLL files, eliminating the hassle of manual searches and downloads.

- **Detailed Log Recording**: After each scan, the tool generates a detailed log file that records the scan time, results, and actions taken for repairs, allowing users to review and track issues conveniently.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clear and concise graphical user interface makes the operation intuitive, enabling even non-technical users to navigate it with ease.

### User Guide

1. **Download and Installation**:
   - Download the tool's zip file from the project homepage and extract it to a local directory.

2. **DLL Files**:
   - The repository contains a `dll` folder that includes all files recorded in the `Dll.sav` file.

3. **Running the Tool**:
   - Double-click the `Dllscan.bat` file and follow the program prompts to complete the necessary operations.

4. **Viewing Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete, open the generated log file to view detailed scan results and repair actions taken.

5. **Rewriting the sav File**:
   - If you suspect that the filenames in the `dll` folder do not correspond with those in the `Dll.sav` list, you can use `Recording.bat` to regenerate the sav file.

### Important Notes

- If you have any doubts about our tool's reliability, please back up important data before making any system modifications to prevent data loss or instability.

- Ensure your operating system is Windows, as the tool may not function correctly on other platforms.

- If the program fails to repair correctly, check if you have sufficient permissions or if the files are complete.

### Additional Usage Methods

- If you only want to know which DLL files are missing from your computer, you can simply download `Dllscan.bat` and `Dll.sav`. These two files will help you identify the missing DLL files, but doing so will disable the tool's ability to repair them.

- If you already know which DLL files your computer is missing, or if you just want to download known DLL files, you can look for the required files in the `dll` folder. While this can be cumbersome, you can also download both `Dllscan.bat` and the `dll` folder. This way, you can quickly find the needed files by entering the full name of the DLL file in the second function of the program's main menu (if you do this, the program will automatically copy the required DLL files to the System32 folder).
